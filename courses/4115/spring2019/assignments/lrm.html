<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions"><a class="header-link" href="#frequently-asked-questions"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p><strong>Q: How is the LRM different from a language tutorial?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Whereas a language tutorial is intended to aid potential users of your language, the LRM should be written for potential implementers of it. In particular, the LRM should attempt to define your languageâ€™s behavior as formally and unambiguously as possible, as opposed to showing what idiomatic code looks like.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does the content of the LRM submission dictate what the language must look like for the rest of the semester?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Not at all! One of the reasons to write the LRM so early is that in trying to formally specify your language, it is more than likely that you will discover some inconsistencies and have to revisit some design choices. You will also invariably make more changes to the language while implementing it. At this stage of the project, the LRM should constitute a best-effort document. Keeping the LRM consistent with your language as you implement features is a very good idea, as you will need to submit a revised LRM consistent with the final version of your language at the end of the semester.</p>

<ul class="list">
<li><p><a href="https://www.dipmat.univpm.it/~demeio/public/the_c_programming_language_2.pdf">The C LRM, found in the C book </a> is excellent.
Note that it is in Appendix A (page 192).
The main body of the book is NOT what your LRM should look like.
That is a language tutorial, not a reference manual.</p>
