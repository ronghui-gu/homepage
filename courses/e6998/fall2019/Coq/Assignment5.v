(** * Problem 3 *)
(** To check whether this Hoare triple is _valid_, we need a way to
    extract the "proof obligations" or the verification conditions
    from a decorated program. The function [VC] takes a [dcom] [d] together
    with a postcondition [Q] and returns a pair of assertions (wp, sd).
    [wp] stands for a weak precondition, while [sd] stands for the
    side conditions that have to hold. Note that this wp is not the
    weakest precondition and sd is used to show that the given loop invariants
    satisfy the required conditions*)

Definition assert_implies (P Q : Assertion) : Assertion :=
  fun st =>  P st -> Q st.
Definition assert_and (P Q : Assertion) : Assertion :=
  fun st =>  P st /\ Q st.

Notation "~~ P" := (assert_not P) (at level 60).

Fixpoint VC (d:dcom) (Q : Assertion) : Assertion * Assertion :=
  match d with
    (* Skip: wp is Q and no side conditions *)
  | DCSkip => (Q, ATrue)
                
    (* Seq: wp is calculated using wp2 of d2.
       sd is the conjunction of sd1 and sd2 since the validity
       of loop invariants are independent
       *)
  | DCSeq d1 d2 =>
    match VC d2 Q with
    | (wp2, sd2) =>
      match VC d1 wp2 with
      | (wp1, sd1) =>
        (wp1, sd1 //\ sd2)
      end

  (* If: again the validity of loop invariants in different

      ((bassn b ->> wp1)
         //\ (~~(bassn b) ->> wp2),
       (sd1 //\ sd2))
    end

  (* While: wp is the loop invariants. 
     sd checks 
     1) inv & b implies the wp of the loop body;
     2) sd of the loop body holds;
     3) inv & ~b implies the post condition *)

         //\ (INV //\ ~~(bassn b) ->> Q)

(** The verification condition for the decorated program is that
    1) the precondition implies wp;
    2) sd always hold *)

    match VC d Q with

    end
  end.

(** And now the key theorem, stating that [verification_conditions]
    does its job correctly.  Not surprisingly, we need to use each of
    the Hoare Logic rules at some point in the proof. *)
