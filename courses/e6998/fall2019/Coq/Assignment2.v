      The computer science department has very strict policies. 
      Please read the department [Academic Honesty page](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/honesty/).
      You MUST submit original homework written by you and you alone.
      Do not look at anybody else’s answer. 
      Do not show anybody your answer, or leave your answer where somebody else could see it.
      Cases of non-original submission will receive a 0 and will be referred to the Judicial Committee.

    1) To compile the assigment, first download the following files
    
    _CoqProject
    Coq_Lecture1_Basics.v
    Coq_Lecture2_Induction_List.v
    Coq_Lecture3_Tactics_Logic.v    
    Assignment2.v
    
    in the same directory.
    
    2) Then generate the Makefile in the command line:
    
    [ coq_makefile -f _CoqProject Coq_Lecture1_Basics.v Coq_Lecture2_Induction_List.v Coq_Lecture3_Tactics_Logic.v -o Makefile ]
    
    3) Make the files by
    
    [make]
*)

(** * Problem 6 *)

(** *** Bags via Lists *)

(** A [bag] (or [multiset]) is like a set, except that each element
    can appear multiple times rather than just once.  One possible
    implementation is to represent a bag of numbers as a list. *)

Definition bag := list nat.

(** Complete the following definitions for the functions
    [count], [sum], [add], and [member] for bags. *)

Fixpoint count (v:nat) (s:bag) : nat
(* REPLACE THIS LINE WITH ":= _your_definition_ ." *). Admitted.

(** All these proofs can be done just by [reflexivity]. *)
Example test_count1:              count 1 [1;2;3;1;4;1] = 3.
 (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
Example test_count2:              count 6 [1;2;3;1;4;1] = 0.
simpl.
 (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

(** Multiset [sum] is similar to set [union]: [sum a b] contains all
    the elements of [a] and of [b].  (Mathematicians usually define
    [union] on multisets a little bit differently -- using max instead
    of sum -- which is why we don't use that name for this operation.)
    For [sum] we're giving you a header that does not give explicit
    names to the arguments.  Moreover, it uses the keyword
    [Definition] instead of [Fixpoint], so even if you had names for
    the arguments, you wouldn't be able to process them recursively.
    The point of stating the question this way is to encourage you to
    think about whether [sum] can be implemented in another way --
    perhaps by using functions that have already been defined.  *)

Definition sum : bag -> bag -> bag
  (* REPLACE THIS LINE WITH ":= _your_definition_ ." *). Admitted.

Example test_sum1:              count 1 (sum [1;2;3] [1;4;1]) = 3.
 (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

  (* REPLACE THIS LINE WITH ":= _your_definition_ ." *). Admitted.

Example test_add1:                count 1 (add 1 [1;4;1]) = 3.
 (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
Example test_add2:                count 5 (add 1 [1;4;1]) = 0.
 (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
